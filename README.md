# Esmoreit Chess
### Uncomplete game for Koding Hackathon

> Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. - *Confucio*

We approach to the Koding Hackathon with innovation as our value.
Our idea was start revolutionary something simple, and keep the simplicity as core value of it.

So we choose one of the oldest game, *Chess*, and we exploit his dimensions.
Unfortunately the capacities and the deadline didn't match the requirements of delivery something playable,
and this for now is just a concept.

We crafted everything by hands, and we spend a lot of time on thinking the game logics (Unfortunately, un-experienceable in the current state).

We're still proud of the result.
The codebase is fine crafted with the latest technology JavaScript libraries and in our opinion represent a good example in how to build next-generation App with JavaScript(ES6/ES7).

Since you can't enjoy playing,
we hope you can enjoy reading.
